# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## General
The project is a charity site for a local Community Men In Sheds
Eleventy frontend with a Sanity CMS backend.

data types:
@cms/schemaTypes/project.js

## Repository structure

Two independent sub-projects:

- `site/` — Eleventy 3.x static site (Nunjucks templates)
- `cms/` — Sanity Studio v5 (content management UI)

All commands below should be run from within their respective subdirectory.

## Commands

### Site (`cd site/`)

```bash
npm start        # eleventy --serve + sanity-watch (live reload with Sanity data)
npm run build    # fetch Sanity data then build static output to public/
```

There are no tests or linting configured.

### CMS (`cd cms/`)

```bash
yarn dev         # run Sanity Studio locally
yarn build       # build studio for deployment
yarn deploy      # deploy studio to Sanity-hosted URL
```

## Site architecture

**Data flow**: At build time, `scripts/sanity-fetch.js` queries Sanity via GROQ and writes `src/_data/projects.json`. Eleventy reads that JSON as global data — no JS data files. In dev, `scripts/sanity-watch.js` opens a real-time Sanity listener and rewrites the JSON on every content change, which triggers Eleventy's file watcher to rebuild.

**CSS**: All stylesheets live in `src/css/` and are concatenated into a single `bundle.css` via `src/bundle.njk` (a Nunjucks template with `permalink: bundle.css`). There is no CSS preprocessor or bundler — utility classes are defined in `src/css/utility.css` using custom breakpoint prefixes (`md:grid-cols-3`, `lg:flex`).

**Templates**: Nunjucks. `src/_includes/base.njk` is the shell layout (header, footer, nav). Pages extend it via frontmatter `layout: "base.njk"`. Partials are in `src/partials/`.

**Per-content-type pages**: Individual project pages are generated from `src/projects/project.njk` using Eleventy pagination (`pagination.data: projects, size: 1`), one page per Sanity document.

## Sanity schema

Sanity project ID: `ah6pphsm`, dataset: `production`.

Current schema types (in `cms/schemaTypes/`):
- `project` — title, slug (from title), content (portable text / rich text), mainImage (with hotspot)

Rich text (`content` field) is converted to HTML in `scripts/sanity-fetch.js` using `@portabletext/to-html` and stored as `contentHtml` alongside the raw blocks.

**Images** are served directly from the Sanity CDN. Append `?w=600&auto=format` (or similar) to the `imageUrl` for automatic resizing and format optimisation.

## Environment variables

`SANITY_READ_TOKEN` — optional Sanity API token. Only required if the dataset is set to private in the Sanity dashboard. Not currently needed.
